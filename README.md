# Clinical-Specialty-prediction
This project aims to predict the clinical speciality by analaysing and classifying the patient's transcription data. 
It takes patients' symptoms, histories, current problems as input and predicts the specialty for the given input as output.
The project is based on natural language processing that cleans, analyses the textual data and uses Tfidfvectorizer and Random Forest Classifier to classify, train and predict the outcome.
The model has been sucessfully trained and now it is capable of predicting the related medical department given the patients' details.
